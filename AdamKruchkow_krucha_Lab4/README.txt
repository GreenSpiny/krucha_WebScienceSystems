Adam Kruchkow - Lab 4: Tweet Parser
===================================

This program reads in Tweets, and then filters them based on user input.
A host server that supports PHP is required (i.e. Apache).

ANGULAR.JS
----------
Angular.js is used to read tweets from a database.

MEDIA QUERIES
-------------
Despite Bootstrap's automatic stacking, media queries are still useful.
When the window is resized and the columns stacked, media queries remove the cell borders.
The text also shrinks at very small window sizes.

QUERIES
-------
The user can filter by text, by hashtag, or the intersection of both.
Matching tweets are isolated and turned yellow.
